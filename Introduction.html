            <h1>The Value of AR/VR in Education</h1>
            <p>In 1957, American cinematographer Morton Heilig created a VR system called Sensorama. But how can VR function in the classroom?</p>
            <br/>
            <p>By introducing new teaching and learning techniques, virtual and augmented reality are transforming education. The ability of virtual reality to bring book content to life and increase learning's fascination and engagement is by far its most evident advantage.</p>
            <figure>
            <h2><u>VR Technology Background</u></h2>
            <p>Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated environment created by computer technology in a three-dimensional space, usually using a virtual reality head-mounted display (VR Headset) and handheld controllers. Let users feel the feeling of being there. This technology can be used to create various virtual environments. When the user moves the position, the computer will immediately perform complex calculations, generate images and send them back to the user for interaction. Virtual reality has a wide range of applications, such as simulating real-world scenes, games, education and training, etc.</p>
        <br/><p>The use of virtual reality (VR) in education is becoming more and more common. It provides an interactive learning environment that can visualize and visualize abstract learning content. Countries use AR/VR for virtual field trips, science experiments, immersive simulations, and other educational tools. The aim is to increase the concentration and initiative of the students. AR/VR devices are becoming reasonably priced and user-friendly, easier to implement in the classroom, and easier to control costs from a school perspective.</p>
        <br/><p>Here are some possible applications of VR in education:</p>

        <h2><u>Simulation labs:</u></h2>
        <p>Compared with traditional methods, using VR by students can reduce the cost of dissection and experimentation and usually cannot be reused. In medicine, virtual reality technology can be used to practice repeatedly on the virtual operating table. Although it feels different from real practice, it has already be used to preview and strengthen memory, which can avoid medical mistakes in actual operations.</p>

        <h2><u>Language learning:</u></h2>
        <p>Provide a simulated language environment for users to learn and practice in the scene. The level can be adjusted according to the learner's performance and response, and the learner can get guidance and improvement suggestions in the process and practice repeatedly.</p>

        <h2><u>Virtual Tours/Musea:</u></h2>
        <p>To provide a travel experience, users can experience the tourist scenes and scenic spots in real situations and display digital cultural relics to understand the culture and history of different places.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2><u>VR/AR Education Statistics</u></h2>
        <p>According to Appventurez (Omji Mehrotra,2021), the worldwide virtual reality in the education market was valued at USD 656.6 million in 2018, according to Fortune BI research. By 2026, it is expected to have grown by 42.9 percent annually to 13,098.2 million USD.</p>
